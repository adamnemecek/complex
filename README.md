# Complex Function Plotter
An online tool for plotting complex functions I made for a computer graphics class. A bit lacking on the interface and documentation side. The idea was inspired by a similar tool made by David Bau, but the code is entirely independent. View at https://wbolden.github.io/complex/ or https://people.ucsc.edu/~wbolden/complex/
